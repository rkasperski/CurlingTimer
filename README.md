Supports the use of HUB75 RGB LED Panels or TVs for the display of
- messages
- elapsed timers
- countdown timers
- team timers
- curling draws; automatic and manual display
- time of day clock
- with additional hardware supports rock timing.

Hardware requirements for TV displays are a TV and raspberry pi 4/5. Requirements for RGB
LED display aare a raspberry pi 3/4(not a 5). Look at bill-of-materials.txt for costs(prices last
updated fall 2024).

Rock timers are a little more complicated to build than the RGB LED displays. See 
bill-of-materials.txt for hardware needs. See doc/breaktimer.odg(use libreoffice) for 
circuit diagram.
